# gloom

> "glom but not as slow"

An utility for retrieving values from deeply nested object attributes, mapping keys, sequence indexes, or any combination of them.

Not meant as a drop in replacement for `glom`, only basic functionality is implemented.  
A good use-case would be to improve existing codebases in which the `glom` pattern is commonly used for convenience, as it can significantly affect performance.
